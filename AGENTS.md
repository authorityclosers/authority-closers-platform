# CODEX NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS

- Do not infer protected business semantics.
- Do not use Naya-owned repos for new AC product work.
- Do not put secrets in Git, vault, skills, logs or prompts.
- Do not make production DB/VPS manual state authoritative.
- Do not use direct SQL edits as an operational recovery path.
- Do not couple payment provider state directly to access.
- Do not turn analytics events into canonical progress/payment state.
- Do not overwrite audit-critical history; supersede.
- Do not create official autonomous AI scoring before AC-SVAL gates.
- Do not process real calls externally before consent/retention/provenance/provider/professional gates.
- Do not build full B2B/native/WhatsApp/voice merely because the architecture preserves those futures.
- A P0 blocks its capability, not the whole project.
- Every code change must leave tests and implementation evidence.


# CODEX SOURCE FETCH ORDER

Use the CSV/JSON manifest. Fetch by exact Drive ID/URL, not filename guesses.

## Required first
1. Master Index
2. BRD
3. AC-IMP-00
4. AC-IMP-01
5. AC-IMP-03
6. AC-IMP-04
7. AC-IMP-05

## Required before first-slice code
PRD, IA, UX Research, UX States, UI System, SRS, Data/Tenancy, API/MCP, Security, QA, DevOps, Admin, Telemetry, ADR/Risk.

## Assurance as relevant
AC-UXA-01 for learner/admin/recovery/accessibility work.
AC-SVAL-01 before any scoring/evaluation work.
AC-GOV-AUD-001 before provider/store/recording/AI data activation.
Hostile audit findings are normalized into AC-IMP-03; do not invent original missing issue text.

## Raw founder evidence
Use only for context and to verify intent. Controlled docs win.

## Cloud research orchestration

For expensive, separable research or review, follow the `cloud-chat-orchestration`
skill at `C:\Users\Suyash\.codex\skills\cloud-chat-orchestration\SKILL.md`.
Codex remains the integration and release owner: pin the source revision, keep
file ownership separate, reproduce relevant claims locally, run the repository
gates, and verify the real deployed journey. Use the authorized normal ChatGPT
Pro chat in Chrome for research when available; if it is unavailable or capped,
record that limitation and continue useful local work or a bounded Luna xhigh
delegate. Never bypass service limits, silently substitute an unapproved model,
send secrets or raw customer data, or treat a cloud-chat handoff as production
evidence. A handoff is accepted only after its claims and artifacts are checked
against the repository and release controls.
